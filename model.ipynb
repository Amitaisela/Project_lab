Upon returning to their saved form, users will be directed to the exact point they last visited, eliminating the need to restart from the beginning. This feature enhances user convenience and accommodates varying time constraints.Effortless Changes Implementation:The redesigned form architecture allows for swift and seamless implementation of changes. No more grappling with the challenges posed by the previous system, where each modification demanded extensive effort.Bug-Resistant Ordering Process:The updated form guarantees a streamlined and more bug-resistant ordering process for both our customers and internal teams.Results:The adoption of this improved process has garnered positive feedback from our users. The heightened satisfaction is a testament to our commitment to delivering not just products, but exceptional experiences., Lightning Experience Transformation (Oct 2019 - Feb 2020): The Lightning Experience transformation in Lumenis was carried out with the aim of improving the UX, UI, and productivity of 900 users.Before the project started, I've educated myself about the key features and the benefits of Lightning Experience. I've also learned how to build a transformation strategy.During the project, I've performed an analysis of our business priorities, the company's org’s readiness to transition, and our technical strategy.We've educated our company about the rollout strategy, including presentations to our executives that outlined the ROI of moving to Lightning Experience, plus the scope, timeline, and cost of the project. We shared Lightning Experience with key stakeholders and demonstrated how they can benefit from the transformation.We have performed the implementations and managed our developers who worked on some code adjustments.I've created training materials (videos and guides) in order to increase the users' adoption, and we've provided hands-on training to our key users, so they will be able to pass their knowledge to their teams.We have tested the changes in our test environments, along with our key users, and made changes, as needed.We've communicated the project implications, as well as the deployment date, to all of the teams involved, and to all of the relevant end-users.Summary:We've Improved the UX, UI, and productivity by moving 90% of the users to Lightning Experience (our community users are still in classic).There is still much to be done since change isn't always easy for some people, but we are very satisfied with the change that was made and the overall adoption., Enabling Country and State Picklists (Jan 2019 - Jul 2019): The implementation of the Country and State Picklist fields was performed in an 11 years old ORG.Working with Country and State text picklist fields enabled users to add Inaccurate or incomplete data.We realized that this data may cause an Inefficiency and lack of quality data.Bad data was preventing us from providing our company's managers and management with an accurate 360-degree view of our business.In order to make the change, I had to update formulas and validation rules. In addition, I've managed our Salesforce developers in order to adjust Apex Classes. During that time, I've fixed the data of millions of records.Before I've enabled the Country and State picklists, I've communicated the project implications, as well as the deployment date, to all of the teams involved, and also to end-users.The project was successfully deployed to our Production environment without any major problems. The project improved our org's data quality, reduced mistakes, and allows our management to make better decisions., Documentation Feature Implementation (Sep 2018 - Nov 2018): The Problem:* Common admin procedures were not documented* Metadata changes or new Metadata developments and implementations were barely documentedWithout documentation, the Salesforce Admins found it hard to perform repetitive procedures. In addition, when the Salesforce Admin tried to solve a process issue, they found it very hard to understand who created the process, why he did it, and how. They didn't even know which component is a part of which process.The Solution:I've created a new custom object that allows Admins to:1. Document procedures - admins are now able to document Salesforce admins' procedures with ease. 2. Document Changes - admins are now able to document changes. They can explain the reason/requirements for the change, and elaborate on what their solution was. We can attach documents on every record, and communicate with other admins through Chatter.The solution I've implemented allows us, the admins, to perform procedures without forgetting anything. It allows us to make fewer mistakes. We also have a clear understanding of how our org operates.Now, all of our essential information and processes are in one, easy-to-access place., Case Management (Feb 2018 - Aug 2018): The Problem:Some of our departments did not have a way to support our company's end-users. We were looking for a better way to manage our processes from first contact to resolution.The Solution:Since two of our departments were already using Salesforce Cases, we decided to design a similar solution for the rest of our company's departments. I've created a design based on the requirements and input of our departments and their support teams.I've implemented the change by using Process Builder, Workflow Rules, Email Alerts, Validation Rules, and Assignment Rules, etc.We have trained our support teams on the new process and then deployed it to the production environment.Now, our end-users are able to contact us at any time and receive a professional, efficient and effective support.)</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>List(LAW-TRAIN (Jun 2015 - Present): LAW-TRAIN is an European Commission funded project aimed at fighting international drug-trafficking by developing a virtual interrogation training system.

Through extensive research in the field of computer science and criminology the mixed reality gaming platform makes it possible to generate characters with changing attributes and parameters. Based on these demographic variables, so called “Virtual Suspects” can be generated, which will give rise to multiple interrogation scenarios in a close to realistic environment.

I picked my device (although it was still alive!) and began to understand what is going on.As I read Samsung's alleged patch to fix the problem, it turned out that the device's embedded eMMC chip is to blame. As I made some clever guesses and used a little bit of magic, I was able to dump the entire firmware of the chip, which appeared to sport an ARM Cortex-M3 core inside.As I went deeper into the firmware, I understood what the bug was and what Samsung was trying to do - stall the device whenever it encounters the bug, instead of fixing it!I wrote a program which low level formats the device in order to avoid the bug. I also added a field upgrade feature so that one may upgrade his eMMC firmware to fix it., Android on A639 (Dec 2012 - Feb 2013): Porting Android to the ASUS MyPal A639 pocket PC device.As our final project of our BSc studies, we ported Android to the ASUS A639 device.

Other than its primary feature - support for booting a Linux kernel, OpeniBoot provides much more features as compared to the native iBoot.I developed the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) which is 100% compatible with Apple's implementation. This allows us to run Linux alongside iOS on the same device.In addition I developed some other drivers such as the Power Management Unit (PMU) driver.Since most of the iPhone's hardware is not publicly documented, during the development we had to use techniques such as black-box debugging and clean room reverse engineering. Furthermore, I wrote an infrastructure which patches iBoot and seamlessly installs traces in order to understand its inner logic.)</td><td>List(Drug library update monitoring, Medication usage auditing based on analysis of infusion pump network traffic, Crowd-based recommendations of a version of firmware for medical devices)</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>List(ML-web-game-platform (Apr 2023): Web platform for training ML models for simple games, initialize it and let it run!, D&D-Party (None): Website for managing D&D parties, build with Flask Python and MYSQL.Allows registration, login, article publication, party view., Img-Classification (None): Classify image of numb value, using convolution neural networks., Kaggle-Titanic-Challenge (None): A submission of a Kaggle competition, creating Classification models to determine survivability., Language-Model (None): LSTM Neural networks for word predictions.)</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>List(Motors Control using CAN bus (Aug 2018 - Jul 2019): Controlling 6 maxon motors that connects to the wheels and controlled via EPOS4 to work simultaneously via CAN bus protocol., None (None): None, FPGA project with digital lock mechanism  (Sep 2018 - Feb 2019): Program using VHDL digital lock mechanism within Spartan-3E FPGA Starter Board)</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>List(onInit (May 2020 - Jun 2020): Developed marketplace for courses, based ReactJS and Redux as state management,NodeJS with express along with web sockets and MongoDB ., Final Degree Project (Oct 2018 - Jun 2019): Departmental Excellence Project with Score 97:Development of a revolutionizing social network app for wandering and lost pets, Based React Native using Firebase database.- Received a social scholarship and selected project at 2019 Engineers Society.)</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>List(The Junction (Dec 2011): At Genesis I help entrepreneurs take it to the next level through The Junction (@thejunction32), a shared space, startup accelerator and alumni organization, all packed into a grungey loft in the south of Tel Aviv.

Upon returning to their saved form, users will be directed to the exact point they last visited, eliminating the need to restart from the beginning. This feature enhances user convenience and accommodates varying time constraints.Effortless Changes Implementation:The redesigned form architecture allows for swift and seamless implementation of changes. No more grappling with the challenges posed by the previous system, where each modification demanded extensive effort.Bug-Resistant Ordering Process:The updated form guarantees a streamlined and more bug-resistant ordering process for both our customers and internal teams.Results:The adoption of this improved process has garnered positive feedback from our users. The heightened satisfaction is a testament to our commitment to delivering not just products, but exceptional experiences.",
          "Lightning Experience Transformation (Oct 2019 - Feb 2020): The Lightning Experience transformation in Lumenis was carried out with the aim of improving the UX, UI, and productivity of 900 users.Before the project started, I've educated myself about the key features and the benefits of Lightning Experience. I've also learned how to build a transformation strategy.During the project, I've performed an analysis of our business priorities, the company's org’s readiness to transition, and our technical strategy.We've educated our company about the rollout strategy, including presentations to our executives that outlined the ROI of moving to Lightning Experience, plus the scope, timeline, and cost of the project. We shared Lightning Experience with key stakeholders and demonstrated how they can benefit from the transformation.We have performed the implementations and managed our developers who worked on some code adjustments.I've created training materials (videos and guides) in order to increase the users' adoption, and we've provided hands-on training to our key users, so they will be able to pass their knowledge to their teams.We have tested the changes in our test environments, along with our key users, and made changes, as needed.We've communicated the project implications, as well as the deployment date, to all of the teams involved, and to all of the relevant end-users.Summary:We've Improved the UX, UI, and productivity by moving 90% of the users to Lightning Experience (our community users are still in classic).There is still much to be done since change isn't always easy for some people, but we are very satisfied with the change that was made and the overall adoption.",
          "Enabling Country and State Picklists (Jan 2019 - Jul 2019): The implementation of the Country and State Picklist fields was performed in an 11 years old ORG.Working with Country and State text picklist fields enabled users to add Inaccurate or incomplete data.We realized that this data may cause an Inefficiency and lack of quality data.Bad data was preventing us from providing our company's managers and management with an accurate 360-degree view of our business.In order to make the change, I had to update formulas and validation rules. In addition, I've managed our Salesforce developers in order to adjust Apex Classes. During that time, I've fixed the data of millions of records.Before I've enabled the Country and State picklists, I've communicated the project implications, as well as the deployment date, to all of the teams involved, and also to end-users.The project was successfully deployed to our Production environment without any major problems. The project improved our org's data quality, reduced mistakes, and allows our management to make better decisions.",
          "Documentation Feature Implementation (Sep 2018 - Nov 2018): The Problem:* Common admin procedures were not documented* Metadata changes or new Metadata developments and implementations were barely documentedWithout documentation, the Salesforce Admins found it hard to perform repetitive procedures. In addition, when the Salesforce Admin tried to solve a process issue, they found it very hard to understand who created the process, why he did it, and how. They didn't even know which component is a part of which process.The Solution:I've created a new custom object that allows Admins to:1. Document procedures - admins are now able to document Salesforce admins' procedures with ease. 2. Document Changes - admins are now able to document changes. They can explain the reason/requirements for the change, and elaborate on what their solution was. We can attach documents on every record, and communicate with other admins through Chatter.The solution I've implemented allows us, the admins, to perform procedures without forgetting anything. It allows us to make fewer mistakes. We also have a clear understanding of how our org operates.Now, all of our essential information and processes are in one, easy-to-access place.",

We were looking for a better way to manage our processes from first contact to resolution.The Solution:Since two of our departments were already using Salesforce Cases, we decided to design a similar solution for the rest of our company's departments. I've created a design based on the requirements and input of our departments and their support teams.I've implemented the change by using Process Builder, Workflow Rules, Email Alerts, Validation Rules, and Assignment Rules, etc.We have trained our support teams on the new process and then deployed it to the production environment.Now, our end-users are able to contact us at any time and receive a professional, efficient and effective support."

The training system is developed in a collaborative action by universities, national governments and professional enterprises.The virtual gaming platform will allow law enforcement units to practice the interrogation of suspects in a multicultural and virtual reality context. Through extensive research in the field of computer science and criminology the mixed reality gaming platform makes it possible to generate characters with changing attributes and parameters. Based on these demographic variables, so called “Virtual Suspects” can be generated, which will give rise to multiple interrogation scenarios in a close to realistic environment. Because of the virtual nature of the system, the simulator will be accessible from any country at any given time. To improve the training results, so called “Intervention Agents” will follow the practice sessions online and give real-time feedback to trainees.",

          "Fixing Galaxy S3 devices by reversing eMMC's firmware and gaining code execution (Jan 2013 - Dec 2017): As many Samsung Galaxy S3 devices around the world started dying, I couldn't stand aside. I picked my device (although it was still alive!) and began to understand what is going on.As I read Samsung's alleged patch to fix the problem, it turned out that the device's embedded eMMC chip is to blame. As I made some clever guesses and used a little bit of magic, I was able to dump the entire firmware of the chip, which appeared to sport an ARM Cortex-M3 core inside.As I went deeper into the firmware, I understood what the bug was and what Samsung was trying to do - stall the device whenever it encounters the bug, instead of fixing it!I wrote a program which low level formats the device in order to avoid the bug. I also added a field upgrade feature so that one may upgrade his eMMC firmware to fix it.",

Other than its primary feature - support for booting a Linux kernel, OpeniBoot provides much more features as compared to the native iBoot.I developed the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) which is 100% compatible with Apple's implementation. This allows us to run Linux alongside iOS on the same device.In addition I developed some other drivers such as the Power Management Unit (PMU) driver.Since most of the iPhone's hardware is not publicly documented, during the development we had to use techniques such as black-box debugging and clean room reverse engineering. Furthermore, I wrote an infrastructure which patches iBoot and seamlessly installs traces in order to understand its inner logic."

Muscle tremors can affect users'​ ability to accurately manipulate icons, leading to frustration and lost productivity.This project seeks to build a prototype User Interface (UI) for use with touch-sensitive screens, which will accept tremor-affected input, and use it to deduce the user's intended input, using machine learning and signal processing techniques to neutralize the effect of the tremor on the usage patterns."

It took 3 years to go over all the departments and to complete the role mining and certification processes. We have had an immediate ROI after starting with our service organization where bulks of employees join, go through courses and shift teams. From a very intensive manual labor of few employees in 3-4 teams, the process now takes minutes to complete and involves only 1 admin to complete 1 unmanaged system.A year later we see a much calmer and more efficient environment.But it requires a hand on the wheel to implement and manage the on-going operation."

Will it be a number? will it be \"3 rooms\"?) and I recommend giving it a try with other use cases you may encounter."

However, most women are unable to properly fit a bra for themselves. Additionally, monthly hormonal fluctuations during various stages of the menstrual cycle cause the breast size to fluctuate. Additionally, monthly hormonal fluctuations during various stages of the menstrual cycle cause the breast volume to fluctuate by up to 40%. Therefore, there is a need for a change in the way we design bras, which first requires proper understanding of the relationships between the forces exerted on the breasts, their size, and the resulting stress distribution. Using FEA, we have simulated the stresses and strains on the breast as a function of its size, both under the static influence of gravity, and during gait movement"

These injuries cause additional damages, such as burdens on the health care system and taxpayer costs estimated by billions of dollars, which are caused as a result of treatment and rehabilitation efforts.Falls can be prevented by early detection and rehabilitation of the gait pattern failures. As of today, the detection of these failures is made possible by performing a gait test which requires the patient to reach a designated laboratory.Safe Walk system is a home sensor kit combined with a web application which supports the detection of abnormal events in the patient's gait pattern, alerts the relevant parties of a failures diagnosis, presents relevant data for an in-depth understanding of the root cause of the problem, creates a rehabilitation program for the patient and continues to monitor its progress."
